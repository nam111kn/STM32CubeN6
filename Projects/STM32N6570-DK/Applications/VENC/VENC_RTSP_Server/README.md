##  <b>VENC_RTSP_Server Application Description</b>

This application provides an example of the H264 video encoder streamed through Azure RTOS NetX/NetXDuo on STM32N6570-DK board.
It also shows how to use the VENC with the camera pipeline in hardware handshake mode.

The application aims to stream an encoded video format H264. Then,the H264 frames are sent through Ethernet peripheral
using the RTP protocol (Real-time Transport Protocol) to a remote client for example
VLC media player. The RTSP protocol (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is used to control
media sessions (SETUP, PLAY, TEARDOWN).

The main entry function tx_application_define() is called by ThreadX during kernel start, at this stage, all NetX resources are created.

 + A <i>NX_PACKET_POOL</i>is allocated
 + A <i>NX_IP</i> instance using that pool is initialized
 + The <i>ARP</i>, <i>ICMP</i>, <i>UDP</i> and <i>TCP</i> protocols are enabled for the <i>NX_IP</i> instance
 + A <i>DHCP client is created.</i>

The application then creates 2 threads with different priorities:

 + **NxAppThread** (priority 10, PreemtionThreashold 10) : created with the <i>TX_AUTO_START</i> flag to start automatically.
 + **AppServerThread** (priority 4, PreemtionThreashold 4) : created with the <i>TX_AUTO_START</i> flag to start automatically.
 + **VENCAppThread** (priority 10, PreemtionThreashold 10) : created with the <i>TX_AUTO_START</i> flag to start automatically.

The **NxAppThread** starts and perform the following actions:

  + Starts the DHCP client
  + Waits for the IP address resolution
  + Resumes the **AppServerThread**

The **AppServerThread**, once started:

  + Starts RTSP server
  + Starts the demo video
  + Displays a report message on the HyperTerminal at each received frame on the VLC media player


The **VENCAppThread**, once started:

  + Initialize the camera stream
  + Initialize the video encoder
  + Encode the video stream and place in an output buffer

Note that this examples uses the VENC and DCMIPP in low latency "streaming" mode. Through a hardware signal, the encoding is done on the fly without needing a full picture input buffer.


####  <b>Expected success behavior</b>

 + The board IP address is printed on the HyperTerminal
 + Streaming video is well displayed on the VLC media player after entering the url: rtsp://[IP]:554  in the Media/Open Network Stream/Open Media window
  (example rtsp://192.168.0.27:554)
 + It is recommended that the caching value is set to 500ms on the VLC to keep the stream running smoothly
  (Media/Open Network Stream/Open Media window => Show more options), then press Play on VLC Play button.
 + The response messages sent by the server are printed on the HyperTerminal.

 Note : This application was tested with VLC version 3.0.19

#### <b>Expected error behavior</b>

+ The red LED toggles each 1000ms to indicate that an error has occurred.
+ In case the message exchange is not completed the Hyperterminal is not printing the received messages.
+ ""Critical error has occurred" message is printed on the HyperTerminal.

#### <b>Assumptions if any</b>

- The application is using the DHCP to acquire IP address, thus a DHCP server should be reachable by the board in the RTL used to test the application.
- The application is configuring the Ethernet IP with a static predefined <i>MAC Address</i>, make sure to change it in case multiple boards are connected on the same RTL to avoid any potential network traffic issues.
- The <i>MAC Address</i> is defined in the `main.c`

```
void MX_ETH_Init(void)
{

  /* USER CODE BEGIN ETH_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE END ETH_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE BEGIN ETH_Init 1 */

  /* USER CODE END ETH_Init 1 */
  heth.Instance = ETH1;
  MACAddr[0] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[1] = 0x80;
  MACAddr[2] = 0xE0;
  MACAddr[3] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[4] = 0x10;
  MACAddr[5] = 0x00;
```
#### <b>Known limitations</b>
None

#### <b>ThreadX usage hints</b>

 - ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.
 - ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it, by updating the "TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND" define in the "tx_user.h" file. The update should be reflected in "tx_initialize_low_level.S" file too.
 - ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.
 - ThreadX offers the "tx_application_define()" function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API.
   It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools...)  but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).
 - Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file.
   ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function,
   using the "first_unused_memory" argument.
   This requires changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
    + For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:
     ```
	 place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };


#### <b>NetX Duo usage hints</b>

- Depending on the application scenario, the total TX and RX descriptors may need to be increased by updating respectively  the "ETH_TX_DESC_CNT" and "ETH_RX_DESC_CNT" in the "stm32n6xx_hal_conf.h", to guarantee the application correct behaviour, but this will cost extra memory to allocate.
- The NetXDuo application needs to allocate the <b> <i> NX_PACKET </i> </b> pool in a dedicated section.
Below is an example of the section declaration for different IDEs.
   + For EWARM ".icf" file
   ```
   define symbol __ICFEDIT_region_NXDATA_start__ = 0x341F8180;
   define symbol __ICFEDIT_region_NXDATA_end__   = 0x341FF980;
   define region NXApp_region  = mem:[from __ICFEDIT_region_NXDATA_start__ to __ICFEDIT_region_NXDATA_end__];
   place in NXApp_region { section .NetXPoolSection};

  This section is then used in the <code> app_azure_rtos.c</code> file to force the <code>nx_byte_pool_buffer</code> allocation.

```
/* USER CODE BEGIN NX_Pool_Buffer */

#if defined ( __ICCARM__ ) /* IAR Compiler */
#pragma location = ".NetXPoolSection"

#else /* GNU and AC6 compilers */
__attribute__((section(".NetXPoolSection")))

#endif

/* USER CODE END NX_Pool_Buffer */
static UCHAR  nx_byte_pool_buffer[NX_APP_MEM_POOL_SIZE];
static TX_BYTE_POOL nx_app_byte_pool;
```

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 1-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Select first the FSBL workspace
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project FSBL (if no modification is done on FSBL project, this step can be done only once)
 - Select the Appli workspace
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated Appli binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the Appli binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in DK board external Flash at address 0x7010'0000.
 - Load the FSBL binary in internal RAM using the IDE
 - Run the example

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:

 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary FSBL.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin FSBL.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o FSBL-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump FSBL-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is FSBL-trusted.bin.
 - In resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the FSBL binary and its header (FSBL-trusted.bin) in DK board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.

Note : when using CubeIDE, make sure to use the Debug configuration for development mode and the Release configuration for boot from flash.
