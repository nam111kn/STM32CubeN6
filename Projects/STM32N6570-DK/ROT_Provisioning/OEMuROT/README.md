## <b>ROT_Provisioning OEMuROT description</b>

This section provides an overview of the available scripts for OEMuROT.

OEMuROT stands for "OEM Updatable Root of Trust" and it provides two services:

  - Secure Boot: Verification of the integrity, and authenticity of the application code before any execution.
  - Secure Firmware Update: If a new firmware image is available on detection, check of its authenticity.
                            Once the firmware is decrypted, check of the integrity of the code before installing it.

- OEMuROT/keys_programming.bat/.sh             Programs OEMuROT keys into OTP.
- OEMuROT/provisioning.bat/.sh                 Performs device provisioning process.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32N6570-DK (MB1939) board and can be easily tailored for
    STM32N6xx devices by following these steps
    (more details in the wiki article [<b>How to create ROT examples for STM32N6</b>](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Security:How_to_create_ROT_examples_for_STM32N6)).



### <b>How to use it ?</b>

The .bat scripts are designed for Windows, whereas the .sh scripts are designed for Linux and Mac-OS.

During the **provisioning process**, the programming scripts and the application files will
be automatically updated according to OEMuRoT configuration.

The **provisioning process** (OEMuROT/provisioning.bat/.sh) is divided into 3 majors steps:

- Step 0: Preliminary stage
- Step 1: Configuration management
- Step 2: Image generations
- Step 3: Provisioning

The provisioning script is relying on flash_programming script.

In the /Config/ folder, two password files are provided:

- **DA_password.bin**: This file contains only the password and is used to program the password hash in OTPs.
- **password.bin**: This file contains the password preceded by a header and is intended for use with
STM32CubeProgrammer to enable non-secure debug.

### <b>Notes</b>

Two versions of AppliCfg (used during **provisioning process**) are available: windows executable and python version.<br>
On Windows environment, the executable is used. On other environment, the python version is automatically used.<br>
To use Python version, it is needed to:

- have python installed (Python 3.6 or newer) and available in execution path variable
- have required python modules installed (Utilities/PC_Software/ROT_AppliConfig/requirements.txt):

        pip install -r requirements.txt
